				total of <span class="computed">{texts.total_millions}</span>
				million doses have been administered so far. On average,
				<span class="computed">{texts.daily_avg_prev_formatted}</span>

				Currently there are four types of Covid-19 vaccines being
				administered in seventeen Spanish regions. These include Johnson
				& Johnson’s single-dose vaccine, Janssenm, and the two-dose
				series: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca/Oxford.
			</p>
			<p>
				The nation focuses on a health risk and age-based vaccine
				rollout plan to protect the most vulnerable groups from
				contracting the disease. In our preliminary analysis with
				available open data, we conclude some notable regional
				differences in vaccination rate and the first sign of vaccine
				effect comparing the nearly 100% vaccinated group versus less
				ones.

			<h6 style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
				Why is there a gap in those regions?
			</h6>
			<p>
				Following the national guideline, each autonomous region (<i
					>Comunidad Autónoma</i
				> abbreviated as CCAA) manages the vaccine administration to its
				priority groups. Every region more or less follows the same rollout
				policy. So why does the gap occur?
			</p>
			<p>
				One possible explanation is that the demography in each region
				is not uniform. The age group of more than 70 years old takes up
				roughly 8% of the whole population in Spain.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the contrary, Castilla y León, Galicia and Asturias which sit
				in the northwestern corner of the country see more than 20% of
				their residents aged above 70 — the largest share of elderly
				across all CCAAs — according to the latest census data.
			</p>
			<p>
				This aging demographic trend coincides with the above national
				vaccination rate regions colored green shown in the above chart.
				This vaccination gap is rooted in the age-based rollout plan.
				The opposite vaccination trends are reflected in the younger
				CCAAs like Madrid, Cataluña and Com. Valenciana where
				vaccination rates lag behind the national average, colored
				orange.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the age group difference can not explain why two
				islands have an older population but see the widest vaccination
				gap below national average in the course of the inoculation
				campaign. Both Canarias and Baleares have approximately 13% of
				its residents aged more than 70, whereas 8% of the whole
				population in Spain is beyond that age.
			</p>
		</div>

		<!-- TopicB -->

		<div>
			<h4>Vaccine effect shown by age group</h4>
			<p>
				Several covid-19 indicators continue their overall downward
				trend since January. However, indices trends of each age group
				diverged after the mass inoculation campaign rolled out
				progressively.
			</p>

			<p>
				People over 80 were the earliest to receive shots. They were the
				most affected measured by the relative terms of covid-19 cases, hospital admissions, severe hospital cases (ICU)
				and deaths in previous waves of outbreak.
			</p>
			<!-- TopicB Tabs -->
			<div>
				<!--
				  Note: tabs must be unique. (They cannot === each other.)
				-->
				<TabBar
					tabs={["Cases", "Hospitalized", "ICU", "Deaths"]}
					let:tab
					bind:active
				>
					<!-- Note: the `tab` property is required! -->
					<Tab {tab}>
						<Label>{tab}</Label>
					</Tab>

				<span class="groupAbove80">⬤</span> 80+
			</p>
			<MultilineWrapper tablabel={active} />
			<p>
				Now with close to 100% vaccinated, the group’s share of cases
				versus its winter peak has been failing and separated itself
				from other younger age groups which received shots later than
				the group.
			</p>
			<p>
				Similar pattern surfaces after the vaccination rolled out to the
				next elderly age groups, 70 to 79, 60 to 69, 50 to 59 and so
				forth.
